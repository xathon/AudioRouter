# AudioRouter
A program combining TeamSpeak and VoiceMeeter remotes.

This program is originally written for use during Production with Elo Hell Esports, although it can be used in various other cases.
It aims to enable Producers to talk to Observers while still keeping an open line to the casters. 
It achieves this by muting adequate routes in VoiceMeeter and TeamSpeak.

## Requirements
- VoiceMeeter Banana or Potato (experimental)
- TeamSpeak3 Client

**In its current state, the software is not usable during live production. For now, it is a proof-of-concept.**
The end goal is to have a software that can be reliably used live by everyone.
